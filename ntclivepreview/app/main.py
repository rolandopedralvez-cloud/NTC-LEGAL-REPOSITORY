"""
app/main.py — FastAPI application entrypoint.

Run:  uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Then open:  http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

This replaces the old `uvicorn main:app` entrypoint. Update start.bat /
NTC.vbs / desktop.py to point at app.main:app (see NOTES.md).

Structure: app.core holds the shared helpers (auth/tokens, permissions,
activity log, ensure_schema — moved verbatim from main.py, zero logic
changes). app.routers/* holds the route handlers, split by feature area.
A handful of read-only routes have been ported to SQLAlchemy (app.routers
.meta, app.routers.licenses_ro, app.routers.pages) as the first step of the
incremental ORM migration described in MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md — everything
else still uses the original raw-sqlite3 helpers in app.core, on purpose,
and will be ported one router at a time later.
